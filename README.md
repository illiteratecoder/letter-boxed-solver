# letter-boxed-solver

This is a simple program I wrote to solve the NY Times online puzzle Letter Boxed
(more information can be found at https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed)
because apparently I have too much time on my hands.

## Usage

Clone this repository, or download the ZIP file.

In the root directory of the repository run `make`.

This will create a build folder with the appropriate resource files and the
executable.

Move to the build folder with `cd build`, and then start the program with `./letterboxedsolver`.
